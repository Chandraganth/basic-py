1. What does RGBA stand for?
  
  REd Green Blue Alpha

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
  
  first import imagecolor from the module
   
   imagecolor.getcolor('red','RGBA')


3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
   
    tuple is a  datatype where we can store  multiple data in a single variable and it can be accessed only in read only format  . box tuple is  a tuple value
    of four integers  corresponds to x,y coordinates , height and  width

4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?
    
    first import image from the module then,
   Img = Image.open('xxx.jpg')
   w,h = Img.size
   w,h


5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?
              
              ImageObject.crop(0,50,50,50)

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?

               Image.save('xxx.jpg')
               
7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
            
            the 'ImageDraw' module
            
8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?

              ImageDraw objects have shape-drawing methods such as point(), line(), or rectangle().
              They are returned by passing the Image object to the ImageDraw.Draw() function
