1. What does an empty dictionary's code look like?

a = {}
if a:
    print('not empty')
else:
    print('empty')

2. What is the value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42?
                  
                  {'foo':42}     value = 42


3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?
    
    list is an ordered collection which can contain different datatypes. it does not require a key value pair
    dictionary contains elements in key value pairs 

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?

                     it will give a KeyError
                     
5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?
                                    
                             if 'cat' is key in spam then spam['cat'] gives the values for key  eg) spam = {'cat':50}   spam['cat] gives output 50
                              spam.keys() gives all the keys in spam dictionary   output = dict_keys(['cat'])
                                                     
6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
                           
       if cat is the key both expression gives the values for the key ,  spam.values() gives all the values in spam and 'cat' gives the value pair for the key 'cat'
       
7. What is a shortcut for the following code?
if 'color' not in spam:
spam['color'] = 'black'

  eg)  spam = {"cat":50,"dog":100}
       spam['color'] = 'black'
       spam
       
       output
       
       {'cat': 50, 'dog': 100, 'color': 'black'}

8. How do you "pretty print" dictionary values using which module and function?
                           
                           by pprint module and function
