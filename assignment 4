1. What exactly is []?

 it is a  list , allows to declare datas inside it 

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
                               
                               spam[2] = 'hello'

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?

                       output = 'd'

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
                    
                    output = 'd'
                    
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
                  
            output =  ['a','b']
                  
Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
                index = 1
                
7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
                        
                     bacon =  [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
                     
8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
                             
                           bacon =  [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]
                           
9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
                  
                  list concatenation operator is +
                  list replication operation is  *
                        
                        
10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
                
                 append() adds the data at the  end  of the list
                 insert() adds the data at a specified  index position
                 
11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
                      1) remove()
                      2) pop(index value)
                      
12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
                   
                   list and  string values are identical in the way that they are in a ordered manner but string values are immutable whereas  lists are mutable 

                        
13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?

           lists are ordered data and mutable . they are given in array brackets[]
           tuples are ordered data and are  immutable . they are given in rounded brackets()
           
14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
                                  
                                  a = (42,) comma after integer
                                  
15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
                    
                    by calling the inbuilt function list() and tuple()
                    
16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
                they contain the references to the list values 
                
17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
                   copy.copy() gives the shallow copy of the data, both original and copied points to the same memory location
                   whereas copy.deepcopy() gives the deep copy of the data where original  and copied values does not point to same memory location
