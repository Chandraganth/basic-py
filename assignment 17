1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string 'too low' if guess_me is less than 7, 'too high' if greater than 7, and 'just right' if equal to 7.

guess_me = int(input())  
if guess_me < 7:
  print("too low")
elif guess_me > 7:
  print("too high")
else:
  print("just right")
  
  
2. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me and the value 1 to the variable start. Write a while loop that compares start with guess_me. Print too low if start is less than guess me. If start equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and exit the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.
guess_me = 7
start = 1

while True:
    if start < guess_me:
        print('too low')
    elif start == guess_me:
        print('found it!')
        break
    else:
        print('oops')
        break
    start += 1

     
too low
too low
too low
too low
too low
too low
found it!


3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.
                      
a = [3,2,1,0]
for i in a:
  print(i)

4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in range(10)
                 
                 a =[i for i in range(10) if i%2==0]
                 a
                 
                 [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
                 
5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares. Use range(10) to return the keys, and use the square of each key as its value.
                     
                     a ={i:i*i for i in range(10)}
                     a
                     
                     {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}
                     
6. Construct the set odd from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension (10).
                   
      a = {i for i in range(10) if i%2==1}
      a
      {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
      
7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string 'Got ' and a number for the numbers in range(10). Iterate through this by using a for loop.

a = ("Got"+str(i) for i in range(10))
for i in a:
  print(i)
                          
Got0
Got1
Got2
Got3
Got4
Got5
Got6
Got7
Got8
Got9

8. Define a function called good that returns the list ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione'].

def good():
  return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']
  
 good()
 
 ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']
 
9. Define a generator function called get_odds that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned.

def get_odds():
    for i in range(1, 10, 2):
         yield i
count = 1
for i in get_odds():
    if count == 3:
        print("The third odd number is", i)
        break
    count += 1
    
10. Define an exception called OopsException. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write the code to catch this exception and print 'Caught an oops'.

class OopsException(Exception):
    pass

def raiseException(num):
    if num < 0:
        raise OopsException(num)

try:
    raiseException(-1)
except OopsException as err:
    print('Caught an oops')
     
Caught an oops


11. Use zip() to make a dictionary called movies that pairs these lists: titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate'] and plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop'].

titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']
plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']
movies = dict(zip(titles, plots))
print(movies)

{'Creature of Habit': 'A nun turns into a monster', 'Crewel Fate': 'A haunted yarn shop'}
